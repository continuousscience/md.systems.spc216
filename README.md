LAMMPS Simulation Example
=========================

This is a repository of live sil code.

The contents can be referenced from any other sil module
using the url `sil://md.systems.spc216/2017-02-25T00:00:00MST`
to specify the project path and date-by-version.

The results from running the code can be downloaded
from the main sil server,
`https://sque.predictivestatmech.org/projects/md.systems.spc216`

Sil is pure functional code, which allows all builds to be parallel.

This example is a work in progress whose purpose is to show the
how MD simulations can be simultaneously flexible, reproducible,
and easy to compose.
